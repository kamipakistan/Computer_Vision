# Computer_Vision
OpenCV is a large open-source toolkit for image processing, machine learning, and computer vision. Python, C++, Java, and many other programming languages are supported by OpenCV. It can analyse pictures and movies to find faces, objects, and even human handwriting. The amount of weapons in your arsenal rises when it is integrated with different libraries, such as Numpy, which is a highly optimised library for numerical operations. All operations that can be performed with Numpy can be combined with OpenCV.

We will learn everything needed to get started with OpenCV in Python in this repository. Since Python is one of the most widely used programming languages, we shall use it. We shall begin from scratch and move forward, By the end of the course, you will be familiar with OpenCV's fundamental concepts and have applied a variety of methods to tackle practical computer vision challenges.
