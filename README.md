# Computer_Vision
OpenCV is a large open-source toolkit for image processing, machine learning, and computer vision. Python, C++, Java, and many other programming languages are supported by OpenCV. It can analyse pictures and movies to find faces, objects, and even human handwriting. The amount of weapons in your arsenal rises when it is integrated with different libraries, such as Numpy, which is a highly optimised library for numerical operations. All operations that can be performed with Numpy can be combined with OpenCV.

You can learn how to process images with OpenCV, from basic to advanced techniques.
